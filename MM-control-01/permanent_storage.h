//! @brief Read and store last filament loaded to nozzle
//!
//! 800(data) + 3(status) EEPROM cells are used to store 4 bit value frequently
//! to spread wear between more cells to increase durability.
//!
//! Expected worst case durability scenario:
//! @n Print has 240mm height, layer height is 0.1mm, print takes 10 hours,
//!    filament is changed 5 times each layer, EEPROM endures 100 000 cycles
//! @n Cell written per print: 240/0.1*5/800 = 15
//! @n Cell written per hour : 15/10 = 1.5
//! @n Fist cell failure expected: 100 000 / 1.5 = 66 666 hours = 7.6 years
//!
//! Algorithm can handle one cell failure in status and one cell in data.
//! Status use 2 of 3 majority vote.
//! If bad data cell is detected, status is switched to next key.
//! Key alternates between begin to end and end to begin write order.
//! Two keys are needed for each start point and direction.
//! If two data cells fails, area between them is unavailable to write.
//! If this is first and last cell, whole storage is disabled.
//! This vulnerability can be avoided by adding additional keys
//! and start point in the middle of the EEPROM.
//!
//! It would be possible to implement twice as efficient algorithm, if
//! separate EEPROM erase and EEPROM write commands would be available and
//! if write command would allow to be invoked twice between erases to update
//! just one nibble. Such commands are not available in AVR Libc, and possibility
//! to use write command twice is not documented in atmega32U4 datasheet.
